Starting from CUDA 5.0, CUDA enables the use of dynamic parallelism for GPUs with compute capability 3.5 or higher. 

Dynamic parallelism allows launching kernels directly from other kernels and enables further speedups in those applications 
which can benefit of a better handling of the computing workloads at runtime directly on the GPU; in many cases, dynamic parallelism 
avoids CPU/GPU interactions with benefits to mechanisms like recursion.

To use dynamic parallelism in Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2013, do the following:

1. View -> Property Pages
2. Configuration Properties -> CUDA C/C++ -> Common -> Generate Relocatable Device Code -> Yes (-rdc=true)
3. Configuration Properties -> CUDA C/C++ -> Device -> Code Generation -> compute_35,sm_35
4. Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies -> cudadevrt.lib
